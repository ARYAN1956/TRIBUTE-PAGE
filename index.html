<div class="About">

    <li>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam BR was an Indian aerospace scientist and statesman who served as the 11th president of
         India from 2002 to 2007.He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. </li>
         &nbsp;
    
    <li>A.P.J. Abdul Kalam attended the Madras Institute of Technology, where he received a degree in aeronautical engineering in 1960.After graduation he joined the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO)—an Indian military research institute—and later the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). Kalam’s associations were not limited to research organizations: he was also associated with political groups, such as the National Democratic Alliance (NDA).</li>&nbsp;
    <li>A.P.J. Abdul Kalam created the Technology Vision 2020 project in 1998. The project sought to develop India’s economy through technology, particularly as applied to agriculture, and increase the availability of health care and education. In recognition of Kalam’s services to the country and broad popularity, the National Democratic Alliance nominated him for president in 2002.</li>&nbsp;
    <li>A.P.J. Abdul Kalam won many awards, both from the Indian government and from the international community. His most notable awards were the Padma Vibhushan, won in 1990, and the Bharat Ratna, won in 1997, for his contributions to science and engineering and service to the government.</li>&nbsp;
    <li>Sir Kalam was entitled to be the 11th president of India. His term period of 25th July 2002 to 25th July 2007 was achieved by winning a presidential election in 2002 with a massive margin of votes. National Democratic Alliances’ nominated him to be president and it was supported by Samajwadi Party and National Congress Party. He was lovingly called as peoples’ president as he had done uncountable works for the welfare of the people and through the entire country.</li>&nbsp;
    <li>He was brave and courageous enough to take decisions and implement them no matter if that was tough or sensitive or highly controversial. The “office of profit” is perhaps the hard Act that he had to sign. The “office of profit”, according to the English Act of Settlement in 1701 explains that no single individual who has a professional set up under the royal family, who has some kind of provision with or who is taking a pension from the prince has the right to work for the of the “House of Commons”. This will allow the royal family to have zero influence on the administrative conditions.</li>&nbsp;
    <li>Dr. Abdul Kalam was a person who was not only a great political leader but also a good teacher and a writer. He had many delicate qualities and visionaries. He always had an excellent dream for the country's development and realized that the youth can bring revolution. During his university career, he inspired many of the students through his inspirational speech and tremendous visionaries. Apart from this, Dr. Kalam was a great writer. He has written several books, which are mainly meant for the nation's empowerment. His creation of India 2020 was like a gift for us, and he had all the strategies to make India a Superpower. In this book, he had primarily focused on some factors like food and development in the Agriculture sector, improved health care facilities, advanced information and communication system, good infrastructure, sufficiency in electricity production, Self-reliance in some advanced technologies.

    </li>&nbsp;
    <li>He was the writer of various motivational books like "India 2010", "Touched off Minds", "Mission India", "The Luminous Sparks", "Wings of Fire", and "Moving Thoughts". His life, work, and convictions are loaded up with models and motivations. He will keep on inspiring us for eternity. Furthermore, this is the genuine justification for why individuals from every one of the segments of the general public precipitously show love for this incredible person on his miserable end at IIM Shillong on 27th July 2015. May this Noble and faithful Soul find happiness in the hereafter!</li>&nbsp;
    <li>Abdul Kalam was elected as the eleventh president of India in 2002 with the assistance of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the then-competition Indian National Congress. He is widely referred to as the "People's President". He spent four decades as a scientist and science administrator, especially on the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), and became concerned with India's civilian space program and army missile improvement efforts.Abdul Kalam lowered back to his civilian lifestyle of schooling, writing, and public career after a single term. He received Bharat Ratna for his prestigious work.</li>
